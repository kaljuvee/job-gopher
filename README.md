   JOBSERVE_PASSWORD = "your_password"
   CV_PATH = "/path/to/your/cv.pdf"
   ```

   SEARCH_KEYWORDS = "data scientist, AI engineer"
   SEARCH_LOCATION = "London"
   JOB_TYPE = "Contract/Full Time"
   MAX_APPLICATIONS = 50
   ```

   export JOBSERVE_EMAIL="your_email@jobserve.com"
   export JOBSERVE_PASSWORD="your_password"
   export CV_PATH="/path/to/your/cv.pdf"
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run the automation with default settings
python run_automation.py
```

### Test Mode (Recommended First)

```bash
# Test with only 2 applications
python run_automation.py --test
```

### Headless Mode

```bash
# Run without opening browser window
python run_automation.py --headless
```

### Custom Application Limit

```bash
# Apply to maximum 10 jobs
python run_automation.py --max-apps 10
```

## Output Files

The script generates several output files:

- `job_applications_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` - Application results in CSV format
- `job_applications_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Application results in JSON format
- `jobserve_automation.log` - Detailed execution log

## How It Works

1. **Login**: Authenticates with JobServe UK using your credentials
2. **Search**: Searches for jobs matching your criteria
3. **Filter**: Filters jobs based on priority and exclude keywords
4. **Apply**: For each suitable job:
   - Opens the job application form
   - Fills in your personal details
   - Uploads or selects your CV
   - Submits the application
5. **Track**: Records application results and saves to files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ChromeDriver not found**:
   ```bash
   pip install webdriver-manager
   ```

2. **Login fails**:
   - Check your JobServe credentials
   - Ensure your account is not locked
   - Try logging in manually first

3. **CV upload fails**:
   - Ensure CV file exists at the specified path
   - Check file permissions
   - Try uploading CV to JobServe manually first

4. **CAPTCHA appears**:
   - The script will log this and skip the application
   - Consider running in non-headless mode to solve CAPTCHAs manually

### Debug Mode

Run with debug logging:
```python
# In config.py
LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
```

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

- ‚öñÔ∏è **Terms of Service**: Ensure compliance with JobServe's Terms of Service
- ü§ù **Rate Limiting**: The script includes delays to be respectful to the website
- üìß **Quality Applications**: Only apply to jobs you're genuinely interested in
- üîí **Data Privacy**: Your credentials are only used for authentication
